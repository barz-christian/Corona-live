# Corona-live

I contributed to the ["Corona-live"](https://corona-live.de/) project of Palaimon.IO by creating maps and tables showing data which was automatically pulled from the local health departments in germany. 
Hence the presented indicators published on ["Corona-live"](https://corona-live.de/) were most of the time available before they got published at [RKI Dashboard](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/478220a4c454480e823b17327b2bf1d4/page/page_1/).

This repository stores a later stage of the user interface only, which was not merged to the project repository. It uses an old data set, because it was about developing a user interface.

Today (17.05.2020) I would change the coloring of the maps again, as in germany we have today defined thresholds and the old coloring was based on quantiles.
