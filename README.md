# Corona-live

I contributed to the ["Corona-live"](https://corona-live.de/) project of Palaimon.IO by creating maps and tables showing data from the local health departments in germany. 
Hence the presented indicators were most of the time published on ["Corona-live"](https://corona-live.de/) before the Robert Koch institute did it ( [RKI Dashboard](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/478220a4c454480e823b17327b2bf1d4/page/page_1/)).



This repository stores a later stage of the development of the user interface only, which was not merged to the project web site and uses an old data set.

Today (17.05.2020) I would change the coloring of the maps again, as in germany we have today defined thresholds and the old coloring was based on quantiles.
